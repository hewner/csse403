A biologist, a statistician, a mathematician and a computer scientist are on

a photo-safari in Africa.  As they're driving along the savannah in their

jeep, they stop and scout the horizon with their binoculars.

The biologist: "Look!  A herd of zebras!  And there's a white zebra!

    Fantastic!  We'll be famous!"

The statistician: "Hey, calm down, it's not significant.  We only know

    there's one white zebra."

The mathematician: "Actually, we only know there exists a zebra, which is

    white on one side."

The computer scientist : "Oh, no!  A special case!"

A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who

had ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether

various objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortue

invariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake,

and a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and

asked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop

between his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex

string which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monk

was enlightened.

From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string after

string by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples,

who passed it on to theirs.

    A doctor, an architect, and a computer scientist were arguing about

whose profession was the oldest.  In the course of their arguments, they

got all the way back to the Garden of Eden, whereupon the doctor said, "The

medical profession is clearly the oldest, because Eve was made from Adam's

rib, as the story goes, and that was a simply incredible surgical feat."

    The architect did not agree.  He said, "But if you look at the Garden

itself, in the beginning there was chaos and void, and out of that the Garden

and the world were created.  So God must have been an architect."

    The computer scientist, who'd listened carefully to all of this, then

commented, "Yes, but where do you think the chaos came from?"

    A manager asked a programmer how long it would take him to finish the

program on which he was working.  "I will be finished tomorrow," the programmer

promptly replied.

    "I think you are being unrealistic," said the manager. "Truthfully,

how long will it take?"

    The programmer thought for a moment.  "I have some features that I wish

to add.  This will take at least two weeks," he finally said.

    "Even that is too much to expect," insisted the manager, "I will be

satisfied if you simply tell me when the program is complete."

    The programmer agreed to this.

    Several years later, the manager retired.  On the way to his

retirement lunch, he discovered the programmer asleep at his terminal.

He had been programming all night.

    A manager was about to be fired, but a programmer who worked for him

invented a new program that became popular and sold well.  As a result, the

manager retained his job.

    The manager tried to give the programmer a bonus, but the programmer

refused it, saying, "I wrote the program because I though it was an interesting

concept, and thus I expect no reward."

    The manager, upon hearing this, remarked, "This programmer, though he

holds a position of small esteem, understands well the proper duty of an

employee.  Lets promote him to the exalted position of management consultant!"

    But when told this, the programmer once more refused, saying, "I exist

so that I can program.  If I were promoted, I would do nothing but waste

everyone's time.  Can I go now?  I have a program that I'm working on."

    A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to your

work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave

at five in the afternoon."  At this, all of them became angry and several

resigned on the spot.

    So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own

working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule."  The

programmers, now satisfied, began to come in a noon and work to the wee

hours of the morning.

    A manager went to the master programmer and showed him the requirements

document for a new application.  The manager asked the master: "How long will

it take to design this system if I assign five programmers to it?"

    "It will take one year," said the master promptly.

    "But we need this system immediately or even sooner!  How long will it

take it I assign ten programmers to it?"

    The master programmer frowned.  "In that case, it will take two years."

    "And what if I assign a hundred programmers to it?"

    The master programmer shrugged.  "Then the design will never be

completed," he said.

    A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day.  The master

noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.  "Excuse me",

he said, "may I examine it?"

    The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master.

"I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,

and Hard", said the master.  "Yet every such device has another level of play,

where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the

human."

    "Pray, great master," implored the novice, "how does one find this

mysterious setting?"

    The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under foot.

    A novice asked the Master: "Here is a programmer that never designs,

documents, or tests his programs.  Yet all who know him consider him one of

the best programmers in the world.  Why is this?"

    The Master replies: "That programmer has mastered the Tao.  He has

gone beyond the need for design; he does not become angry when the system

crashes, but accepts the universe without concern.  He has gone beyond the

need for documentation; he no longer cares if anyone else sees his code.  He

has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect within

themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident.  Truly, he has

    A novice asked the master: "I have a program that sometimes runs and

sometimes aborts.  I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am totally

baffled. What is the reason for this?"

    The master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand

the Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.  Why

do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?  Computers

simulate determinism; only the Tao is perfect.

    The rules of programming are transitory; only the Tao is eternal.

Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment."

    "But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?" asked the

novice.

    "Your program will then run correctly," replied the master.

    A novice asked the master: "I perceive that one computer company is

much larger than all others.  It towers above its competition like a giant

among dwarfs.  Any one of its divisions could comprise an entire business.

Why is this so?"

    The master replied, "Why do you ask such foolish questions?  That

company is large because it is so large.  If it only made hardware, nobody

would buy it.  If it only maintained systems, people would treat it like a

servant.  But because it combines all of these things, people think it one

of the gods!  By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort."

vice-presidents and accountants.  It issues a multitude of memos, each saying

'Go, Hence!' or 'Go, Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant.  Every year new

names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail.  How can such an

unnatural entity exist?"

    The master replies: "You perceive this immense structure and are

disturbed that it has no rational purpose.  Can you not take amusement from

its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming

beneath its sheltering branches?  Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"

    A novice programmer was once assigned to code a simple financial

package.

    The novice worked furiously for many days, but when his master

reviewed his program, he discovered that it contained a screen editor, a set

of generalized graphics routines, and artificial intelligence interface,

but not the slightest mention of anything financial.

    When the master asked about this, the novice became indignant.

"Don't be so impatient," he said, "I'll put the financial stuff in eventually."

A person who is more than casually interested in computers should be well

schooled in machine language, since it is a fundamental part of a computer.

        -- Donald Knuth

%

    A program should be light and agile, its subroutines connected like a

strings of pearls.  The spirit and intent of the program should be retained

throughout.  There should be neither too little nor too much, neither needless

loops nor useless variables, neither lack of structure nor overwhelming

rigidity.

    A program should follow the 'Law of Least Astonishment'.  What is this

law?  It is simply that the program should always respond to the user in the

way that astonishes him least.

    A program, no matter how complex, should act as a single unit.  The

program should be directed by the logic within rather than by outward

appearances.

    If the program fails in these requirements, it will be in a state of

disorder and confusion.  The only way to correct this is to rewrite the

program.

    A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software

conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: "What sort

of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and were

unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their

clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed out hospitality suites and they

made rude noises during my presentation."

    The manager said: "I should have never sent you to the conference.

Those programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life absurd,

an accidental coincidence.  They come and go without knowing limitations.

Without a care, they live only for their programs.  Why should they bother

with social conventions?"

    A sheet of paper crossed my desk the other day and as I read it,

realization of a basic truth came over me.  So simple!  So obvious we couldn't

see it.  John Knivlen, Chairman of Polamar Repeater Club, an amateur radio

group, had discovered how IC circuits work.  He says that smoke is the thing

that makes ICs work because every time you let the smoke out of an IC circuit,

it stops working.  He claims to have verified this with thorough testing.

    I was flabbergasted!  Of course!  Smoke makes all things electrical

work.  Remember the last time smoke escaped from your Lucas voltage regulator

Didn't it quit working?  I sat and smiled like an idiot as more of the truth

dawned.  It's the wiring harness that carries the smoke from one device to

another in your Mini, MG or Jag.  And when the harness springs a leak, it lets

the smoke out of everything at once, and then nothing works.  The starter motor

requires large quantities of smoke to operate properly, and that's why the wire

going to it is so large.

    Feeling very smug, I continued to expand my hypothesis.  Why are Lucas

electronics more likely to leak than say Bosch?  Hmmm...  Aha!!!  Lucas is

British, and all things British leak!  British convertible tops leak water,

British engines leak oil, British displacer units leak hydrostatic fluid, and

I might add Brititsh tires leak air, and the British defense unit leaks

secrets... so naturally British electronics leak smoke.

CAR and CDR now return extra values.

The function CAR now returns two values.  Since it has to go to the trouble

to figure out if the object is carcdr-able anyway, we figured you might as

well get both halves at once.  For example, the following code shows how to

destructure a cons (SOME-CONS) into its two slots (THE-CAR and THE-CDR):

    (MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND (THE-CAR THE-CDR) (CAR SOME-CONS) ...)

For symmetry with CAR, CDR returns a second value which is the CAR of the

object.  In a related change, the functions MAKE-ARRAY and CONS have been

fixed so they don't allocate any storage except on the stack.  This should

hopefully help people who don't like using the garbage collector because

it cold boots the machine so often.

The garbage collector now works.  In addition a new, experimental garbage

collection algorithm has been installed.  With SI:%DSK-GC-QLX-BITS set to 17,

(NOT the default) the old garbage collection algorithm remains in force; when

virtual storage is filled, the machine cold boots itself.  With SI:%DSK-GC-

QLX-BITS set to 23, the new garbage collector is enabled.  Unlike most garbage

collectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather

than from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantly

more Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like "Do you

remember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?", and if you can't give a reasonable answer

in thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.  The variable

SI:%GC-QLX-LUSER-TM governs how long the GC waits before timing out the user.

Although it is still a truism in industry that "no one was ever fired for

buying IBM," Bill O'Neil, the chief technology officer at Drexel Burnham

Lambert, says he knows for a fact that someone has been fired for just that

reason.  He knows it because he fired the guy.

    "He made a bad decision, and what it came down to was, 'Well, I

bought it because I figured it was safe to buy IBM,'"  Mr. O'Neil says.

"I said, 'No.  Wrong.  Game over.  Next contestant, please.'"

AmigaDOS Beer: The company has gone out of business, but their recipe has

been picked up by some weird German company, so now this beer will be an

import.  This beer never really sold very well because the original

manufacturer didn't understand marketing. Like Unix Beer, AmigaDOS Beer

fans are an extremely loyal and loud group. It originally came in a

16-oz. can, but now comes in 32-oz.  cans too.  When this can was

originally introduced, it appeared flashy and colorful, but the design

hasn't changed much over the years, so it appears dated now.  Critics of

this beer claim that it is only meant for watching TV anyway.

... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a

programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting

down, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That

behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and

never when standing.

Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal

know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,

know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to

hypothesize: was there a loose wire under the carpet, or problems with static

electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.

An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard:

the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a

touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led

astray by hunting and pecking.

... Any resemblance between the above views and those of my employer,

my terminal, or the view out my window are purely coincidental.  Any

resemblance between the above and my own views is non-deterministic.  The

question of the existence of views in the absence of anyone to hold them

is left as an exercise for the reader.  The question of the existence of

the reader is left as an exercise for the second god coefficient.  (A

discussion of non-orthogonal, non-integral polytheism is beyond the scope

As in Protestant Europe, by contrast, where sects divided endlessly into

smaller competing sects and no church dominated any other, all is different

in the fragmented world of IBM.  That realm is now a chaos of conflicting

norms and standards that not even IBM can hope to control.  You can buy a

computer that works like an IBM machine but contains nothing made or sold by

IBM itself.  Renegades from IBM constantly set up rival firms and establish

standards of their own.  When IBM recently abandoned some of its original

standards and decreed new ones, many of its rivals declared a puritan

allegiance to IBM's original faith, and denounced the company as a divisive

innovator.  Still, the IBM world is united by its distrust of icons and

imagery.  IBM's screens are designed for language, not pictures.  Graven

images may be tolerated by the luxurious cults, but the true IBM faith relies

on the austerity of the word.
