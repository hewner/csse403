%% The final project will be used to make prolog do some natural language
%% processing.

%% BEFORE YOU START, take a look at the book chapter "Prolog Grammar Rules"
%% on Moodle.

%% The basic ideal will be to build a system with knowledge of student
%% grades, and a processing system that respond to human queries about
%% grade results.  You can see what the knowledge looks like here:

grade(steve,boy,97).
grade(anne,girl,97).
grade(sally,girl,88).
grade(mike,boy,77).
grade(cathy,girl,81).

% Stage A: Writing a basic parse
%
% Stage A of this project will focus on the design of a single parse
% function.  This is the heart of our NLP engine, and we'll want to
% make it as extensible as possible.
%
% Parse will be used like this:
%
% ?- parse([what,is,the,highest,grade],Result).
% Result = 97
%
% Note that the input is a list of atoms, all lowercase.  The type of
% result will vary depending on the question asked, but will always
% be relatively simple.  Certian questions, however, can have more
% than one valid response (e.g. WHO has the highest grade will return
% two responses...but this can be handled in the usual prolog way).

% Stage A1 [5 points].  Make the example parse above work.

% Stage A2 [5 points].  Modify the code so that it will also return
% the lowest grade.

% Stage A3 [5 points].  Modify the code above so you can use a variety
% of synomyns for highest/lowest (largest, biggest, best, or whatever).

% Stage A4 [10 points].  Modify the code so that you can ask
% [who,has,the,highest,grade] and simliar queries (should return a
% name).  You'll want to be careful to prevent too much duplication.
%
% Stage A5 [5 points].  Modify the code so that you can restrict the
% range of the search.  If I say [...,above,82] it should restrict the
% search to grades above 82.  If If I say [...,above,mike] and mike is
% a name in the db, it should restrict the grades to grades above that
% student's grade.
%
% Stage A6 [5 points].  Same as above, but now if I say [...,for,girls]
% it should restrict the search to girls.  If I say [...,for,a,students]
% it should restrict the grades for students who have a grade in the 90s.
%
% Stage A7 [5 points].  Add the ability to have unlimited restrictions
% with "who are".  So I can say
% [...,for,girls,who,are,b,students,who,are,above,85].
%
% That last one may be tricky - remember it's only worth 5 points if you
% skip it.
%
% Stage B [30 points]: Handling Input

% We would like to be able to access this function without using
% prolog's strange interface.  Instead, I'd like to be able to run a
% prolog function that puts prolog into an input mode where I can
% just type questions and it will answer.
%
% For example:
%% ?- do_nlp(start). % I couldn't get do_nlp to compile without a parameter
%% |: what is the highest grade?
%% 97
%% |: what is the lowest grade?
%% 77
%% |: done?
%% bye
%% true .
% Some restrictions:
%
% Questions will always be just a series of words seperated by spaces
% - no commas or other strangeness.
%
% Questions will always end with a ?
%
% Everything is always is lowercase
%
% done? ends the loop
%
% hint: note that once you finish parsing a question, a '\n' is likely still
% stored in input and will be returned as a character when you next call
% get_char.  Make sure your input ignores it or your 2nd parse may be messed
% up.
%
% Stage C [30 points]: Improved parsing
%
% It's up to you!  Expand the NLP parser to be able to answer a
% greater variety of questions.  You should at least include 2 new
% structurally different questions (e.g. count the students that, is
% it true that) that have some internal variations.  Beyond that, have
% a good time.  Feel free to improve output, do error handling - just
% make some signifigant improvements of yur own.
%
% Include in the comments a fairly complete description of the kinds
% of new questions you support and any other features you added.
