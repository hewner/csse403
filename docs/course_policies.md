This document outlines the main course policies for CSSE403.

Instructor: Dr. Mike Hewner (feel free to call me Buffalo)

# Introduction

This is a course about languages that go beyond the paradigms you are
familiar with.  Most of the languages we study are not currently
popular (though their adherents think they will be someday) but they
provide different perspectives on programming: perspectives that will
often seem bizarre and unusual.  The goal of the course is to
understand these perspectives, and perhaps take away a little insight
into our own everyday programming.  The secondary is goal is to
improve your skill in learning new programming languages.

Both of these will be most naturally addressed by writing a lot of
code, in a lot of strange languages.

# Learning Outcomes

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

Write programs in a variety of programming language paradigms (such as statically type-safe functional languages, object-based languages, or process-oriented languages) using the features unique to those paradigms.

Identify the semantic similarities and differences between a new programming language and previously known languages. Clearly explain the key semantic features of a new programming language, including how to begin using it and its strengths and weakness.

Develop medium-sized applications in a new programming language through independent study. (Here "medium-sized" implies a project that a team of three might develop over a period of seven weeks in parallel with other course work.)

# Book

No book is required for this class, although we will use 1 chapter from the very nice

Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce A. Tate

# Grading

| Category               | Weight |
|------------------------|--------|
| Small Assignments      | 38%    |
| Medium Assignments     | 38%    |
| Final Language Project | 19%    |
| Class Participation    | 5%     |

## Small Assignments

As we are introducing programming languages, there will be small daily
assignments.  You’ll submit them via Moodle.  These projects must be done
individually.

## Medium Assignments

There will also be 3 larger projects – one for each of the 3 main
programming languages we will be discussing in class.  These projects
can be done individually or in pairs.

*You are additionally required to have a score of at least 50% on all
of the Medium assignments*, or you will receive an F in the course.  If
you miss a deadline, talk to me and I’ll probably think of a way you
can make it up at least to the 50% level.  The reason for this policy
is that you are required to really become proficient in each of the
languages we study, which can’t really be done without experiencing it
on a larger project.

## Final Language Project

The last few weeks will be a team project where you will learn a new
programming language (your choice), do an in-class lecture about it
(with assignment), and do a large scale project appropriate to that
language.  Projects will be demoed during the final exam time (or
earlier, if your team finishes earlier).

## Class Participation

I do think attending class has value, and I like to provide a gentle encouragement to do so. Attendance will be taken every day electronically and at the end of the term your attends record affects your grade as noted above excluding a generous number of "dropped" attendance days (i.e. I allow a certian number of missed days at no penalty). 

These dropped days will allow for missed days for illness, interviews, sporting events etc AND for forgetting to register attendance occasionally. You are responsible for electronically entering attendance. I will not retroactively grant attendance (because if I do so, I will be quickly be overwhelmed with students’ attendance update requests).

Sometimes students might have special circumstances that makes full attendance impossible. If you
have these, you should probably contact me as I describe in the Special Circumstances section. I resolve special circumstances by providing overall course-level rule exceptions—not by giving credit for individual missed days in the attendance policy.

## Final Exam

There is no final exam, but projects are demoed in the final exam
time.

# Course Evaluation and Feedback

Please feel free to provide feedback about the course at any time. If
you feel uncomfortable talking with me directly, there is an anonymous
feedback box on the Moodle page for this course where you can provide
feedback throughout the term; I get notified when it is updated and
will try respond to feedback in a reasonable time.

# Late Submissions

Late assignments are handled on a case-by-case basis.  If the excuse
seems reasonable (and the privilege is not getting repeatedly abused),
I generally offer 24 or 48 hour extensions (almost never more than
that, however).

# Special Circumstances

If circumstances have caused you to miss/fail several assignments OR if your current situation in PLP
seems overwhelming, you should contact the me right away. Sometimes I can find special accommodations 
not listed here.

# Generative AI

The use of generative AI is not allowed on any of the assigments in this course.

# Academic Integrity

It is critical to maintain academic integrity. It is essential for all
students to cite any and all sources of help received in completing
coursework. This practice not only fosters a culture of honesty and
transparency but also prevents misunderstandings that might otherwise
escalate to formal proceedings. Students should also be aware of what
is appropriate help on homework assignments – <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared Documents/Pilot Integrity Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy - What Constitutes Misconduct.docx?d=w72d3dc4b233d4df68e10736359a06c80&csf=1&web=1&e=QWvFcM">see policy here</a> ). To
ensure fairness and responsibility, any instances of suspected
misconduct will be handled through the CSSE Integrity Committee. 

If a case of suspected misconduct arises, it will be submitted to the
CSSE Integrity Committee for review (see <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared Documents/Pilot Integrity Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy - Procedures.docx?d=wf4c70babf3ac434ba29d5518dca9f877&csf=1&web=1&e=1efwlT">policies and procedures here</a>
and <a href="https://rosehulman.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/CS/Shared Documents/Pilot Integrity Policy/IntegrityPilotPolicy - Penalties %26 Evidence.docx?d=w916e293ca31a4493bdbdd6b78ed2d3dd&csf=1&web=1&e=wCWF2K">possible penalties here</a>). The process includes an initial review
of the evidence by the committee, a time for students to explain or
admit to potential misconduct, and potentially a hearing to examine
the circumstances and evidence. Students are encouraged to continue
their studies and engage with the course material and instructor
normally throughout the investigation.

Beyond the policy of this course, the Student Handbook and
Rose-Hulman’s Academic Rules and Procedures describe penalties and
processes invoked as a consequence if academic misconduct (such as
cheating, plagiarizing, or interfering with the academic progress of
other students) takes place.  It is the responsibility of each student
to know and follow Rose-Hulman’s rules about academic integrity.
