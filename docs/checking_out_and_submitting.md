# Checking Out Assignments

All assignments are stored in the github repo.

[https://github.com/hewner/csse403](https://github.com/hewner/csse403)

You can checkout using any git tool you are familiar with, but if you
like the command line version it looks like this:

    git clone git@github.com:hewner/csse403.git
    
If you've already checked out the repo and want to make sure you're
getting the latest version of the class notes and assignments, be sure
to pull.

    git pull

# Submitting Assignments

Simply submit all source code files to the corresponding moodle
assignment.

## What files should I upload?

* Don't upload files we provide but that you haven't edited
  (e.g. tests)
* Don't zip all your files together - that makes things annoying
* Don't include compiled files
